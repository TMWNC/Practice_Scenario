# Practice Scenario 

This is a practice programming scenario aimed at level 3 students. you will find 3 files attached to this document 

CSV KPI <- A zipped file 
frmInput <- a C# file 
frmRetrieve <- a C# file 


you are tasked to run a code analysis on the given c# files to discern the purpose of the program and the constructs
that have been used within the application. 

This is a forms application and the full form application has been provided to allow you to experiment with the application. 
you are however expected to submit fully annotated versions of the frmInput and frmRetrieve C# files explaining your findings
using comments. 

You should aim to
- explain the role of the application in terms of purpose
- comment on the quality of the code interms of maintainability, reusability and how it meets SOLID principles 
- Explain the use of constructs and techniques within the code using correct terminology throughout
- Explain any improvements that you would make to the code (It is not required to implement the changes but you can take it as a challenge)

you will be expected to upload this as a branch on git hub with the following files 
- an updated frmInput which is fully annotated 
- an updated frmRetrieve which is fully annotated
